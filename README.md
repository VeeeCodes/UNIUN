## UI Library:
    USE SHADCN for UI Refer [SHAD CN DOCS](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
    UI SHOULD be modern, minimalistic, futuristic and clean with only SHADCN components
    UI and UX should look similar to https://x.com/ with colors black, gold and red as the theme colors of the site. The site should premium and end to end interactale with modern experience.

## Tech stack:
    Backend: NodeJs 
    Frontend: NextJs with Typescript and ReactJs with Shadcn Material UI
    DB: Neo4J, VectorDB, MongoDB
    Monitoring: Graphana, Prometheus

## Installation & Setup
        Quickstart (local, development):

        Prerequisites:
        - Docker & Docker Compose v2
        - Node.js 18+ (for local dev if not using Docker)

        1) Build and run with Docker Compose (recommended):

             Open a terminal at the repo root and run:

             ```bash
             docker compose build
             docker compose up
             ```

             This will build the frontend and backend images and start supporting services:
             - frontend: Next.js app on http://localhost:3000
             - backend: Node API on http://localhost:4000
             - neo4j: Graph DB (bolt on 7687, HTTP on 7474)
             - mongo: MongoDB (27017)
             - milvus: Vector DB for embeddings (stand-in for VectorDB)
             - prometheus: Monitoring on 9090
             - grafana: Dashboard on 3001

        2) Local development (without Docker):

             - Frontend:

                 cd frontend
                 npm install
                 npm run dev

             - Backend:

                 cd backend
                 npm install
                 npm run dev

        Configuration:
        - Environment variables are read from `.env` in each service directory (not checked in). Example env keys:
            - BACKEND_PORT, MONGO_URI, NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USER, NEO4J_PASSWORD

        Notes & next steps:
        - The scaffold provides a minimal, enterprise-friendly structure and health endpoints. It does not implement full product features (shadcn UI components, authentication, payments, media storage). Those are next steps.
        - See `docker-compose.yml` for service ports and credentials.
## Containerization & Deployment
    A `Dockerfile` is provided for both `frontend` and `backend`. Use the included `docker-compose.yml` for local orchestration. For production, adapt Dockerfiles to your cloud provider's build pipeline and replace development settings (for example, use a managed vector DB and managed Neo4j or cloud-hosted databases).
## Testing
    The scaffold includes basic health endpoints and a tiny test harness can be added with Jest/Playwright for unit and E2E tests. Add CI steps (GitHub Actions) to run lint, unit tests, and build.
## Monitoring
    Prometheus and Grafana are included in `docker-compose.yml`. The backend exposes a `/health` endpoint; instrument further metrics (Prometheus client) and add dashboards in Grafana.
## Future Scope
    Add Audio Content Page

## Copilot Instructions
Write end to end enterprise grade, clean, reusable, expandable, fully scalable code for this application using the requirements and techstack mentioned above.

## E2E & WebRTC notes

- Playwright E2E tests are scaffolded under `frontend/e2e`. To run them locally:

```bash
# from repo root
pnpm install
cd frontend
pnpm -s e2e:install   # installs Playwright browsers
pnpm -s e2e           # runs the tests against localhost:3000
```

- The WebRTC demo (`/uniun`) supports configuring STUN/TURN servers via env vars:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STUN` (defaults to `stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`)
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURN` (optional, e.g. `turn:turn.example.com:3478`)

When running in CI, the GitHub Actions workflow `./github/workflows/e2e.yml` will start the Docker Compose stack and run Playwright tests.
